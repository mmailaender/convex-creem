# Convex Backend - `convex-creem`

This directory contains the Convex app used by the examples and by the Creem
billing component integration.

## Files

- `convex.config.ts` registers the `@mmailaender/convex-creem` component.
- `billing.ts` creates the `Creem` client, resolves the billing entity, exports
  generated billing functions, and contains demo credit actions.
- `http.ts` registers the Creem webhook route at `/creem/events`.
- `schema.ts` contains demo app tables. Replace the demo `users` lookup with
  your real auth or organization model.

## Required Convex Env Vars

```bash
npx convex env set CREEM_API_KEY <your_creem_api_key>
npx convex env set CREEM_WEBHOOK_SECRET <your_creem_webhook_signing_secret>
npx convex env set CREEM_SERVER test
```

The examples default to the Creem test server unless `CREEM_SERVER=prod` is set
in Convex env.

For the credit-pack demo, keep the trusted product ID in Convex env:

```bash
npx convex env set CREEM_ONETIME_CREDITS prod_...
```

Browser `VITE_*` variables are only for frontend widgets. Webhook fulfillment
must use server-side Convex env values.

## Billing API Exports

`billing.ts` uses:

```ts
const {
  uiModel,
  snapshot,
  checkouts,
  subscriptions,
  products,
  customers,
  transactions,
  orders,
  credits,
} = creem.api({ resolve });
```

The public exports are then passed to frontend `ConnectedBillingApi` objects:

- `uiModel`
- `checkoutsCreate`
- `subscriptionsUpdate`
- `subscriptionsCancel`
- `subscriptionsResume`
- `subscriptionsCancelScheduledUpdate`
- `plansActivate`
- `customersPortalUrl`
- `transactionsSearch`
- `creditsCreateAccount`
- `creditsGetBalance`
- `creditsCredit`
- `creditsDebit`
- `creditsListEntries`

Additional SDK-mirrored exports such as product, customer, order, pause, and
list functions are available for app-specific admin or backend flows.

## Product Sync

Creem product metadata must be synced into Convex before pricing widgets can
show product names, prices, descriptions, and images.

```bash
npx convex run billing:syncBillingProducts
```

`syncBillingProducts` is an `internalAction`. It is meant for the Convex CLI,
Convex dashboard, scheduled jobs, or trusted internal functions, not direct
browser calls.

## Webhooks

`http.ts` calls `creem.registerRoutes(http, { path: "/creem/events" })`.

Configure Creem to send webhooks to:

```text
https://<your-convex-site-url>/creem/events
```

The component handles supported checkout, subscription, refund, dispute, and
credit grant events. Add custom `events` handlers in `http.ts` for app-specific
side effects such as analytics, email, or audit logging.

## Auth Resolver

The example resolver calls `api.billing.getUserInfo`, which reads the first row
from the demo `users` table. Replace this with production auth:

```ts
import { ConvexError } from "convex/values";

const resolve: ApiResolver = async (ctx) => {
  const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
  if (!identity) throw new ConvexError("Not authenticated");

  return {
    userId: identity.subject,
    email: identity.email!,
    entityId: identity.subject, // or the active org/team ID
  };
};
```

Use `entityId` for the billing owner. For team billing, resolve the active org
ID instead of the user ID.

## Demo Credit Spending

`generateDemoImage` demonstrates the right shape for app-owned credit spending:
the backend action calls `creditsDebit`; the frontend `Credits.Root` only
refreshes and displays the balance.
